# Ethics in Data: The Genovian Ethical Data Organisation (GEDO)

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a collaborative effort to establish ethical guidelines for data practitioners and organisations handling data. The **Genovian Ethical Data Organisation (GEDO)** was formed to create a **Data Charter** and a **Data Hippocratic Oath**, aiming to promote transparency, fairness, and accountability in data practices.

This project was undertaken as part of a **group effort**, considering real-world implications of ethical data handling and governance.

## Objectives
- **Define ethical principles** for individuals working with data.
- **Establish a charter** for organisations managing and processing data.
- **Promote responsible AI and data governance** aligned with legal and ethical standards.
- **Encourage transparency, fairness, and inclusivity** in data-driven decisions.

## Key Deliverables
### **Hippocratic Oath for Data Practitioners**
Inspired by the traditional medical **Hippocratic Oath**, this version is tailored for **data practitioners** to uphold ethical responsibilities across the data lifecycle. The oath includes commitments to:
- **Integrity & Honesty** – Maintain transparency in data collection and analysis.
- **Respect for Privacy & Human Rights** – Ensure informed consent and data security.
- **Fairness & Non-Discrimination** – Mitigate bias in data-driven models.
- **Transparency & Reproducibility** – Make methodologies clear and accountable.
- **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement** – Ensure deployed models remain fair and reliable.
- **Data Retention & Disposal** – Retain data only as necessary and ensure responsible disposal.

### **Charter for Organisations Using Data**
The **Data Charter** defines organisational commitments to responsible data handling. Key principles include:
- **Benefit for Society** – Data use should provide measurable benefits to the public.
- **Transparency & Accountability** – Organisations should disclose how data is collected, processed, and used.
- **Privacy & Security** – Implement strong safeguards to protect personal data.
- **Fairness & Inclusivity** – Avoid biases and ensure equitable AI systems.
- **Sustainability** – Consider the environmental impact of data processing and AI.
- **Compliance with Legal Frameworks** – Adhere to the **EU AI Act** and **GDPR** regulations.
- **Regular Audits & Third-Party Assessments** – Conduct periodic evaluations of AI models and data usage.

---

## Technologies & Frameworks Considered
- **EU AI Act** – To ensure compliance with high-risk AI system regulations.
- **GDPR** – To maintain strict data privacy standards.
- **Benchmarking Data Service Data Charter (UK Government)** – For best practices in data transparency.
- **Open Data & London Data Charter Principles** – Used as guiding references.

## Implementation & Review Process
1. **Research Phase**: Studied existing ethical frameworks, including the medical Hippocratic Oath and legal AI regulations.
2. **Drafting Phase**: Created the initial versions of the **Oath** and **Charter** in collaboration with team members.
3. **Refinement & Peer Review**: Incorporated feedback and real-world considerations for practical application.
4. **Final Presentation**: Proposed the GEDO Oath and Charter as part of an **ethics competition** where organisations voted on the best framework.
5. **Evaluation & Future Improvements**: Plans for integrating AI governance and periodic policy updates.

## Challenges Faced
- **Balancing innovation with ethical constraints** – Ensuring AI and data-driven solutions remain responsible without stifling progress.
- **Creating enforceable guidelines** – Moving beyond theoretical ethics to practical, actionable policies.
- **Addressing AI bias and transparency** – Developing methodologies to mitigate model bias and ensure fairness.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Ethics Certification** – Establishing a certification for data professionals adhering to the GEDO principles.
- **Public Policy Integration** – Working towards government adoption of ethical AI and data governance.
- **Automation of Audits** – Using AI to monitor compliance with the ethical charter.
